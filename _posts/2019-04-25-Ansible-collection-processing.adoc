As a Java developer, I sometimes dream that I can use the Java 8+ Stream API in my Ansible playbook to process list and dict variables.

== Jinja Filters

The main tool for this purpose are Jinja filters. There are 2 libraries of filters available:

* The Jinja http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/#list-of-builtin-filters[builtin filters].
  This list can also be found in Ansible source code https://github.com/pallets/jinja/blob/master/jinja2/filters.py[filters.py].
* The https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_filters.html#[Ansible filters]

Filters are similar to Unix or Anguler pipes and can be chained. 

Like in other data processing libraries there two kinds of operators:

* *Mappers* which take stream of element and produce stream of elements: selectattr, rejectattr, map, list
* *Reducers:* which take a stream of elements and produce a single  element: join, first, last, max, min

<1> Take the `id` attributes of `users` having `admin` set to true and join them.
<2> Take the `users` havin `admin` set to false and count them. As the `rejectattr` filter returns an iterator, but the `count` filter requires a list, I have to use `list` filter to convert it.

The `selectattr`/`rejectattr` filters can take 3 arguments: the attribute, a boolean operator and an argument.
The operator can be chosen among Jinja's http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/#list-of-builtin-tests[builtin tests].
This list can also be found in Ansible source code https://github.com/pallets/jinja/blob/master/jinja2/filters.py[tests.py].

With Ansible 2.7+, the `map` filter can take 3 arguments: the attribute, an operator and arguments.
The operator can be chosen among Jinja filters, and will be applied to each element of the list.

<1> For each `users` take its name and when the regular expression matches , apply the replacement, then join the result.

== JSON Query

Another strategy is to use a JSON Path to walk down the YAML tree.

----
include::{source_dir}/group_vars/all.yml[tags=json_query]
----
<1> Take the `id` attributes of `users` having `admin` set to true and then join them.
<2> Take the `id` attributes of `users` having `role` set to `assistant` and then join them.

This `json_query` is based on the `jmespath` Python https://pypi.org/project/jmespath/[library], this means:

. You can use http://jmespath.org/[jmespath.org] web site to cook your JSON path query.
. You'll have to add the `jmespath` library to your Python virtual env.

Sadly, nesting JMES path expressions inside Jinja template expressions inside YAML files can be tedious.
This following example fails, even if the JMES path is alright in Python interpreter.
